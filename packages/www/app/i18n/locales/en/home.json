  "about": {
    "title": "What is this about?",
    "content": "It is possible to establish digital organizations - with democratic decision-making, collective ownership, global coordination - to act in line with the direction of its members (they’re called <i>DAO</i> - Digital Autonomous Organization). Additionally, the digital asset economy with tokens, digital art, and NFTs is an exciting opportunity for a community with a strong cultural identity like Capoeira. Our mission is to apply these innovations to Capoeira’s microcosm to add value and services that directly benefit the community itself."

    "title": "Axé DAO",
    "content": "Axé DAO is the name of our model of governance. It facilitates transparent, equitable decision-making processes among its members to collectively hold funds and decide how to use them. One of the primary goals for funding is the creation of common digital tools for Capoeira, like an open-source app, digital identity, and a registry. Long-term, it is an explicit goal to be able to fund individual projects and events and direct financial support into the community where it’s needed.<br/><br/>The DAO may decide to launch the Axé token, a digital unit symbolizing the positive energy of Axé. Its main use is to be passed around as a meme in the community to signal appreciation (for someone’s work or a jogo or the organizers of an event) and it would be distributed in a fair launch via the app and registry. It may also play a role in the governance of the organization."
