    "introduction": "We are Capoeiristas from different corners of the world bringing the innovations and tools of <i>web3</i> to the Capoeira community to create shared value. It is time for Capoeira to build its own open infrastructure with shared ownership and governance to shape the future of this art form we love.<br /><br />Like Capoeira, the cypherpunk culture from which <i>web3</i> originates is rooted in the spirit of autonomy, resistance, freedom and self-determination. Axé DAO is a pioneering effort by Capoeiristas for Capoeiristas to channel collective resources into efforts that benefit Capoeira guided by the principles of decentralization and collective action."
